## Pick One Language for the Interview


You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:

- C++
- Java
- Python

You need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.

### Interview Prep

- [ ] [Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview, 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Through-Interview/dp/111941847X/)
    - answers in C++ and Java
    - this is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview
    - not too difficult, most problems may be easier than what you'll see in an interview (from what I've read)
- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
    - answers in Java

### If you have tons of extra time:

Choose one:

- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews (C++ version)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/)
- [ ] Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version)
    - [book](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517435803/)
    - [Companion Project - Method Stub and Test Cases for Every Problem in the Book](https://github.com/gardncl/elements-of-programming-interviews)

### Language Specific

**You need to choose a language for the interview (see above).**

Here are my recommendations by language. I don't have resources for all languages. I welcome additions.

If you read through one of these, you should have all the data structures and algorithms knowledge you'll need to start doing coding problems.
**You can skip all the video lectures in this project**, unless you'd like a review.

[Additional language-specific resources here.](programming-language-resources.md)

### C++

I haven't read these two, but they are highly rated and written by Sedgewick. He's awesome.

- [ ] [Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structure, Sorting, Searching](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Parts-1-4-Fundamentals-Structure/dp/0201350882/)
- [ ] [Algorithms in C++ Part 5: Graph Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Part-Graph-3rd-Pt-5/dp/0201361183/)
- [ ] [Open Data Structures in C++](https://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp.pdf)
    - Rich and detailed collection of Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Great for first-timers

If you have a better recommendation for C++, please let me know. Looking for a comprehensive resource.

### Java

- [ ] [Algorithms (Sedgewick and Wayne)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/)
    - videos with book content (and Sedgewick!) on coursera:
        - [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1)
        - [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

OR:

- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - used as optional text for CS intro course at UC Berkeley
    - see my book report on the Python version below. This book covers the same topics

### Python

- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - I loved this book. It covered everything and more
    - Pythonic code
    - my glowing book report: https://startupnextdoor.com/book-report-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/
- [ ] [Open Data Structures in Python](https://opendatastructures.org/ods-python.pdf)
